    "Welcome to the Tournament Arc text-based application! With the creation of your own tournament line-ups, Tournament Arc's tracker provides tournament representatives an application to apply any number of participants for sign-up (showing the available spots), cancel their sign-up, track a participant's starting positions (allowing the rep to search for the participant's starting spot simultaneously), allowing them to see (at most) the last 5 participants before them and the next 5 participants after them, as well as a hard save feature (prompts the rep if they'd like to save their changes before exiting the application). Files can be saved as either .json or .csv files."
